					<div class="project-text">TrackMyFitness: Exercise Tracker is a revolutionary app for the fitness buff (pun intended). Exercise Tracker uses the built-in sensors of Android Wear and Apple Watch to automatically detect exercises and count repetitions. This product offers apps for iOS, Apple Watch, Android, and Android Wear.</div>

					<div class="project-text-title">Problem</div>
					<div class="project-text">If you step foot in a gym, you’ll undoubtedly find people writing down their workouts with pen and paper. But c’mon, it’s the 21st century, and we feel that there’s a better way to track your fitness. Sure, there are a ton of apps out there that will tell you how many steps you’ve taken in a day, but what about those push ups or sit ups you’ve been doing? It’s important to keep track of those too, and we believe that this is a perfect use case for wearable technology.</div>
					<div class="project-text-title"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KC_rd7-bf0" class="hoverline" target="_blank">What is this, a screen for ants!? →</a></div>
					<div class="project-text">I'll be honest, designing for wearable devices is challenging&mdash;the screen is just so tiny! But since the main concept of this app revolves around wearables, I had little time to sit and complain. In a perfect world, you could simply walk into the gym, open our app, and let it track everything you're doing without any interaction or input. Alas, this world is far from perfect, and unfortunately, so is technology. What happens if we detect the exercise incorrectly? What if we missed a rep? What happens if it's a static exercise? To counteract all these what-if scenarios, we built several flows into the watch app that help ensure accurate and flexible logging. Following detection, you can quickly confirm or add a new exercise name, adjust the rep count, and add weight if it was used. If you're performing a static exercise, it's most likely being held for a certain amount of time, so we also added stopwatch and timer functionality.</div>

					<div class="project-text-title">Data that counts</div>
					<div class="project-text">Nobody logs their workouts, and then throws away the paper. That would be absurd (and not very eco-friendly). You log your workouts so you can track progress and see improvement along the way. The companion phone app allows you to do just that. Everything you save on your wearable device is displayed on your phone so you can actually view and analyze your data. Drill in to each individual exercise that you perform so you can see your trends, as well as use your past data to help increase your reps or weight as necessary.</div>

					<div class="project-text-title">But like, what if I don't have a smart watch?</div>
					<div class="project-text">Well, you're in luck my friend. The phone app allows you to manually enter your workouts so that you can still track all your progress, even without a fancy wrist accessory. We spent a lot of time working on the add and edit features to make it as quick and efficient as possible. You can add or edit each set with a simple scrolling selector. Depending on who's reading this, you may be thinking, "I lift like 500 pounds...I don't want to scroll all the way there every time!" It just so happens that since we save all your workout data, we can pre-populate the fields with your most recent data. And if you want to be old-fashioned, you can always just tap the number to bring up the keyboard and enter the value there!</div>
