					<div class="project-text">SAP Scouting is a software application that empowers football franchises in the NFL to evaluate, identify and acquire the talent that fuels their teams' on-field success. By spending less time searching for, collecting, and entering data, teams can spend more time actually watching and evaluating players. SAP Scouting is currently helping the San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins with their drafting and roster decisions.</div>

					<div class="project-caption">The home screen provides a glimpse into all the recent transactions across the NFL. Normally, teams receive daily, plain-text emails that detail who was released, traded, etc. This is very important information and the faster the data can be consumed, the quicker decisions can be made. To help this process, we take the email data and visualize it in a way that focuses on the players at hand.</div>

					<div class="project-text">I worked as Lead Visual Designer, though I also worked hand-in-hand with (and often as an extension to) our very talented interaction designers.

					<div class="project-text-title">Problem</div>
					<div class="project-text">Scouting can be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Scouts must keep track of hundreds of players at a time and be able to make confident and educated decisions that can have huge impacts on their respective NFL teams. Currently, scouts use out-dated (see: prehistoric) software, alongside never-ending Excel sheets and binders piled ceiling-high. Our goal was to reinvent this process, while at the same time, be able to provide new information and insights that were previously unavailable or nearly impossible to discover. </div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="project-text">We had the rare pleasure of having direct access to our users throughout the entire design process. As co-innovators, the 49ers were willing to spend countless hours with us to brainstorm, ideate, and validate. This proved to be invaluable, especially since we had no prior experience in the industry, except for one person who's been a 49er fan their entire life (<span class="me_text">that's me</span>). We created personas and storyboards which lead to the detailed user stories that we would design for. With a complicated process like scouting, it was often hard to keep the scope from getting out of hand, but we felt it was important to successfully implement the key features first.</div>

					<div class="project-text">Comparing players is easily the most important aspect of a scout's job, so we spent a great deal of time trying to find the best solution to allow for constant, in-context comparisons. We ended up combining search and compare features so that scouts could easily compare both individuals and groups of players. By default, search results show the overview of players. This includes important personal information, grades and alerts given by scouts, as well as key measurable information such as height, weight, and speed. Each players' measurable data is also shown in a graph that places them in a percentile of the rest of the players in that position. </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<img src="images/Scouting/search-stats.png" class="shadow imageMargin img-responsive">
					<div class="project-text">With the given search results, a scout can also look at players' pro stats, college stats, and even compare them against past successful players. The data table, alongside a data visualization allows for a complete and well-informed analysis, which in turn, helps scouts make better decisions for their respective organizations.</div>
